    Sorry, no catches yet. ðŸ˜•

  As we saw in the video, the index.html.erb template renders the _no_catches.html.erb partial if
  there are no fish catches. And that partial is rendered within a Turbo Frame. So when
  the "Log a catch!" link is clicked, Turbo expects the response to have a matching Turbo Frame.
  But the link runs the index action of the TackleBoxItemsController, and the correponding index.html.erb
  template doesn't render a matching Turbo Frame. So you need to change the link so that it breaks out of the frame.
